# Python-Fundamentals-for-Bioinformatics

## Learning Outcomes
    • Core Python Programming: Automate workflows and address bioinformatics challenges using Python’s control structures, functions, and data structures effectively.
    • Handling Biological Data:
        ◦ FASTA: Analyze nucleotide and protein sequences, including computing composition, generating complements, transcription, translation, ORFs, motifs, and performing pairwise alignments.
        ◦ FASTQ: Assess read quality scores, visualize data with box plots and GC content plots.
        ◦ GenBank: Extract and analyze gene annotations and sequence features from GenBank files.
        ◦ PDB: Visualize protein secondary structures.
        ◦ GFF/GTF: Parse and analyze genomic features using Pandas.
        ◦ Phylogenetic Trees: Construct and visualize trees from Newick and CLUSTAL formats.
        ◦ Count Tables: Conduct differential expression analysis and generate volcano plots and heatmaps.
    • Data Analysis and Visualization: Utilize NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for comprehensive data analysis and visualization, including differential gene expression studies.
    • Automating Workflows: Retrieve and manage data from online databases (NCBI, Ensembl), and automate bioinformatics tasks such as quality control and data trimming using command-line tools like BLAST, FastQC, and Trimmomatic.
    • Project Application: Design and implement a bioinformatics project, analyze results, and present findings, showcasing practical Python skills and their application to real-world bioinformatics problems.
